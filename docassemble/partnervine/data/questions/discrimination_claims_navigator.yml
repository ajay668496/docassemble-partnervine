  The Discrimination Claims Navigator summarizes US federal discrimination law for employees. We do not cover discrimination not related to your employment or claims under the laws of the state or territory where you reside.
  
   The Discrimination Claims Navigator will provide you with a standardized analysis of your claims, but will not help you with filing your claims. **Please note that your claims may be subject to filing deadlines, and you are responsible for the preparation and timely filing of your claims.**

    **Claims under state or local law.** Many state and local governments have their own anti-discrimination laws, and these laws may offer extra protection beyond the federal laws.
    
    Some state laws:
    
    * Apply to businesses with only five or six employees 
    * Prohibit discrimination based on whether you're married or have children
    * Have different deadlines for filing a charge 
    * Have different standards for deciding whether you’re covered by them
    
    If you think you may have a claim under the laws of your state or local government, we suggest you contact qualified counsel. The Discrimination Claims Navigator only covers US federal law.
    
    **About the Navigation Bar.** If you are not on a smartphone-sized device, you should see a navigation bar to the left of your screen. The navigation bar shows you which law we're discussing.

Your employer or potential employer is protected by the ministerial exception to anti-discrimination laws. The ministerial exception, sometimes known as the \"ecclesiastical exception,\" is a legal doctrine in the United States barring the application of anti-discrimination laws to religious institutions' employment relationships with its \"ministers.\" As explained by the Supreme Court in the landmark case <em>Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. E.E.O.C.</em> , the exception is drawn from the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and seeks to both (1) safeguard religious groups' \"freedom . . . to select their own ministers,\" a principle rooted in the Free Exercise Clause, and (2) prevent \"government involvement in ecclesiastical decisions,\" a prohibition stemming from the Establishment Clause. When applied, the exception operates to give religious institutions an affirmative defense when sued for discrimination by employees who qualify as \"ministers;\" for example, female priests cannot sue the Catholic church to force their hiring. However, exactly which types of employees should qualify as a \"ministers,\" and thus how broadly the exception should apply, is the subject of current litigation before the Supreme Court.</p><h6><center><strong>What's next?</strong></center></h6><p>We have taken you through an interview that provides an analysis of claims under federal law, but you may have claims under state or local law.

  label: Help
  heading: Why are churches and religious institutions special?
  content: |
    Churches and religious institutions enjoy special protection from claims of discrimination because of the *free exercise of religion* clause of the U.S. constitution. 
    
    Because of that special protection, neutral or generally applicable laws may be applied differently to churches and religious institutions.
    
    Religious institutions are not restricted to the institutions of traditional religions like Christianity, Islam, Hinduism or Buddhism, but are broadly defined to cover religious conduct undertaken by more than just individual adherents.

  content: |
    Exactly which types of employees should qualify as a "ministers" or "priests" is the subject of current litigation before the Supreme Court. In some jurisdictions, teachers at a religious school perform the functions of a minister or priest. In others, it is less clear. If you are in doubt on this issue, choose "I don't know."

  The indicator above reflects the value of your claim(s). Because special protections apply under the *free exercise of religion* clause of the U.S. Constitution, your chance for a successful discrimination claim is **low**.
  
  Your employer or potential employer is protected by the **ministerial exception** to anti-discrimination laws. The ministerial exception, sometimes known as the "ecclesiastical exception," is a legal doctrine in the United States barring the application of anti-discrimination laws to religious institutions' employment relationships with its "ministers." As explained by the Supreme Court in the landmark case *Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. E.E.O.C.* , the exception is drawn from the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and seeks to both (1) safeguard religious groups' "freedom . . . to select their own ministers," a principle rooted in the Free Exercise Clause, and (2) prevent "government involvement in ecclesiastical decisions," a prohibition stemming from the Establishment Clause. When applied, the exception operates to give religious institutions an affirmative defense when sued for discrimination by employees who qualify as "ministers;" for example, female priests cannot sue the Catholic church to force their hiring. However, exactly which types of employees should qualify as a "ministers," and thus how broadly the exception should apply, is the subject of current litigation before the Supreme Court. 
  
  The claims indicator above reflects your response that you applied to be a minister, a priest or a role that performs the functions of a minister or priest. If you would like to reconsider that answer, click **Back** in the header above and you will return to that question.
  
  <div align="center"><p><strong>What's next?</strong></p></div align="center">
  
  We have taken you through an interview that provides an analysis of claims under federal law. Since the Ministerial Exception is a matter of federal constitutional law, it is a binding precedent on state and local law. State and local law may interpret federal constitutional law differently, however. At this stage, you will want to decide if you want to move forward with your claim(s). If you want to move forward, we suggest you consult with a lawyer. A lawyer can help you with an analysis of state and local law, and help you with several issues that are beyond the scope of this navigator, including:
  
  * comparing your facts and circumstances to others in a similar situation;
  * understanding how you would do in the court or administrative agency that would hear your claim(s);</li><li>estimating the value of your claim(s);   
  * estimating how much it would cost to pursue your claim(s); and
  * negotiating with your employer or filing your claim(s).

question: |
  Your employer may claim that you are applying for a role that performs the function of a minister or priest. Your employer may be eligible for **special protection under the *free exercise of religion* clause of the U.S. Constitution**, and we suggest that you consult qualified legal counsel in your jurisdiction.

  If you are not sure if the job you are applying for is a role that performs the function of a minister or priest, you may fall in an area of the law that has not been defined by the US Supreme Court. In some jurisdictions, the courts have considered teachers that work for religious institutions as performing enough of the role of a minister or priest that the religious institution should receive the protection of the free exercise of religion clause in hiring for that role. Other jurisdictions have proceeded differently or have not addressed the issue. If you would like to consider your discrimination claim further, we suggest that you consult qualified legal counsel in your jurisdiction.

  heading: About the small company exemption to Title VII
  content: |
    Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("**Title VII**") does not apply to companies with less than 15 employees. 
    
    If your employer or potential employer has less than 15 employees, you may be covered by state or local laws, some of which apply to companies with as few as five or six employees. If you think you may have a claim under state or local law, we recommend that you contact qualified counsel in your jurisdiction.
    
    **How do you count your employer's employees?**
    
    Here is some help for counting your employer's employees, which comes from guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission:
    
    * All employees, including part-time and temporary workers, are counted for purposes of determining whether an employer has a sufficient number of employees.
    
    * An employee is someone with whom the employer has an employment relationship. The existence of an employment relationship is most readily (but not exclusively) shown by a person's appearance on the employer's payroll.
    
    * Independent contractors are not counted as employees. This is because the work they perform is based on an independent contractual relationship, not an employment relationship.

    **Does your claim concern age, disability or genetic information?**
    
    Don't worry, if your claim is in respect of age, disability or genetic information, we will get to that later in the interview. These questions are in relation to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which doesn't cover age, disability or genetic information.
    
    **Does your claim concern pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions?**
    
    Pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions are included in discrimination claims based on sex for our purposes here. 
    
    **Background.** The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 extended the protection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions. "Related medical conditions" is the subject of judicial interpretation and may include infertility and abortion.
    
    The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 also prohibits harassment and retaliation. It also requires that employers treat employees, who are temporarily unable to perform job functions because of pregnancy or related medical conditions, the same as other employees who are temporarily disabled. Equal treatment includes holding positions open for pregnancy-related leave for the same time period as for disability or sick leave.

  content: |
   A policy can be in writing or communicated orally by management.
   
   If the policy is in writing, then you'll need a copy of that policy to support your claim. 
   
   The policy doesn't have to be in writing for you to have a claim for discrimination though. If the policy has been communicated orally by management, that can also be grounds for a discrimination claim.
   
   If your claim proceeds to court, the judge or jury will decide if the employer's policy is discriminatory. They'll consider the written policy (if there is one), and the testimony of witnesses to a policy communicated orally by management. If a written policy is not followed by management, they will consider that as well.

  heading: What is direct evidence of discriminatory intent?
  content: |
   The best claim for discrimination under the Civil Rights Act is one where there is direct evidence of discriminatory intent. The next questions take you through different situations where there is evidence of discriminatory intent. The situation for this question is that the evidence is fairly clear.
   
   The example for direct evidence of discriminatory intent that is usually cited is *Slack v. Havens*. In that case, four black employees were told they must do a janitorial assignment in their department while a white woman was excused.  When asked why the white woman was excused, the employees' immediate supervisor said: “Colored people should stay in their places, they are hired to clean because they clean better”. The black employees refused the cleaning assignment and were fired. They successfully sued, and their case is strong precedent for direct evidence of discriminatory intent.

   If your situation is not that clear, click **I don't know** and we will see if your situation comes closer to the fact pattern for cases that are not as clear.
